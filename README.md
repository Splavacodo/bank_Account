# bank_Account
This is a project which is meant to showcase knowledge in Object Oriented Programming in C++. The project includes classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to allow the program to be more abstract and easier to understand. This project is completely a console project with no UI as it's only purpose is to showcase OOP in C++. 

The program provides the user with a menu of letters they can type to do certain actions. These actions include viewing your accounts, adding a new account, depositing to all accounts, withdrawing from all accounts, and exiting. The reason the program deposits to all accounts was to make the program more complex and wasn't made to model a real application.
